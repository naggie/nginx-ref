# Main context can be cached for 10 mins, public, meaning CDNs can also
# cache it. Setting it to a short time allows CDNs to take the majority
# of the traffic given a surge, whilst still allowing for relatively quick
# updates.
#
# Whilst nginx can set the expires header automatically and using nice
# units, the newer (HTTP/1.1) Cache-Control header is preferred as it
# prevents expiry spikes and takes precedence anyway.
#
# Note that if you're using cloudflare, HTML pages are not cached by default.
# To enable the cache, set a page rule for a wildcard.
#
# Note also that you should use private cache control or no cache for user
# session or dynamic pages. Only use this for anonymous pages.
